# Refold-ES1K-Template
My goal is to update this as I continue learning Spanish using Comprensible Input (CI). 
Currently I've only made changes to the prompts tailored to beginners. Now the cards show the word, with a picture, and the sentence for context. And they continue doing the default behavior once flipped except now the translation is shown for the sentence automatically.

**Example**

## How to change the cards to use this
1. Start studying
2. Click Edit
3. Click Cards
4. **COPY WHAT THE DEFAULT VALUES AND SAVE THEM SOMEWHERE IN CASE YOU WANT TO GO BACK**
5. Copy the contents of the repo's [beginner branch](https://github.com/TheNewLad/Refold-ES1K-Template/tree/beginner) files into their respective template section:

   front-template.html -> Front Template

   back-template.html -> Back Template

   styling.css -> Styling
